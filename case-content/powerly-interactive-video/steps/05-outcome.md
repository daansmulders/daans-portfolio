The APIs behind the Woningcheck weren’t yet flexible enough to support a fully personalized video flow, and producing professional-quality video content required time and resources that weren’t available at the time.

Although the concept wasn’t launched, the exploration proved valuable. It strengthened our understanding of homeowners’ needs, validated interactive video as a promising direction, and informed future thinking around scalable expert guidance.
