The Woningcheck delivered recommendations based on limited information, which meant they were sometimes too generic and occasionally inaccurate. This made it harder for homeowners to fully trust the advice and left them insufficiently prepared to take the next step and speak with an expert.

<!--

A clearer, more accurate Woningcheck led to higher conversion, more expert calls, and a stronger foundation for ongoing improvements.

*My role*
Research, UX design, concept development, implementation guidance.
