The Woningcheck was a tool to help homeowners understand which sustainable measures were the best option for their home in terms of investment, cost savings and feasability.

The Woningcheck delivered recommendations based on limited information, which meant they were sometimes too generic and occasionally inaccurate. This made it harder for homeowners to fully trust the advice and left them insufficiently prepared to take the next step and speak with an expert.

<!--
