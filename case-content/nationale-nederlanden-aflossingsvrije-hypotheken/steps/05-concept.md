After the sprint, I developed the chosen direction into detailed storyboards and concept mockups. These helped stakeholders understand the proposed end-to-end experience and discuss trade-offs across touchpoints.

The first concrete step was designing a new digital tool to help customers understand their risk, outline repayment options, and explore next steps. While my UX colleague led the full experience design, I supported with feedback, design guidance, and key screens.

In parallel, we worked with content and communication teams to improve letters, emails, and call scripts, ensuring the entire journey — not just the tool — became clearer and more consistent.
