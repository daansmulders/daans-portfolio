From a customer perspective, the goal was to prevent surprises at the end of the mortgage term. Customers needed clarity about whether they were at risk and support in understanding sensible next steps if they were.

For the business, the challenge was equally complex: collecting the information required by regulators, assessing risk accurately, and reducing dependence on an external call center — a major cost driver — by moving the right parts of the process into digital tooling.

This wasn’t just a form or tool problem. It was about reshaping how customers and the business navigate a critical financial moment together.
